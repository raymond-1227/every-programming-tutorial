# every programming tutorial series

## About

So I basically copied the code from the "every programming tutorial" video (tutorial one fyi), which is the world's largest pain because the video quality was like 480p and brackets are totally blurry.

## LMAO

The codes from the first and second episode would result errors already when editing the codes. 

## Original Code?

OMG PLEASE IF YOU KNOW WHERE DID THE ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE CAME FROM PLEASE DM ME VIA DISCORD TYSM.
